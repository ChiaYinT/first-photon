show_geometry.m show velten's optical setup

find_first_photon.m use peak detection to find the first-returning photon of different parts of the scene
cluster_first_photon.m find first-returning photons that are frome the same scene.

main.m    create first-returning photon reconstruction
main_multi_obj.m  create first-returning photon from all parts of the scene shape reconstruction
create_figure.m show reconstruction results
